# ENOSYS: Looks like ENOSYS is often misused in the kernel so checkpatch always
#         warns on seeing ENOSYS. Our use is correct, though!
#         (Nonexistent syscall was called)
# EXPORT_SYMBOL: Buggy for our use-case, let's just ignore this.
# AVOID_EXTERNS: Checkpatch will complain if you extern in a .c file instead of
#                a .h file. Given that supermom is so simple, we'll ignore this.
